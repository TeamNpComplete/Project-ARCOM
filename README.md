# Title : 
  ARCom - 3D Product Visualization App using Augmented Reality

# Description of the hack 
## Problem :
1. One of the greatest drawbacks of shopping online is the lack of a tangible merchandising experience that physical stores and retail outlets provide.
2. All the current e-commerce sites display products in such a way that customers do not get the complete perception of products.
3. Often, customers that buy online have never seen the product. They want to examine things from every angle on their screen.

## Solution :
1. With the help of Augmented Reality, we will develop an application that will super impose the virtual images of any product onto the physical environment by means of a smart phone.
2. The application will grant customers, who typically shop online, the chance to view the product in form of a model they can interact with, in the same manner they would, if they were visiting a physical store.

## Tech stack used :
1. Android Studio
2. Unity 3D
3. ARCore
4. Firebase Realtime Database

## Libraries and dependencies required for the project :
1. ARCore Library
2. Smartphones should be ARCore compatible. It can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/supported-devices#google_play_devices).

## Installation steps :
1. Download the sample.apk file and install it on android device supporting ARCORE.
2. Select the product you want to check in click on '3D' button below the product image.
3. Point your camera where you want to place object and wait for ground plane to be detected.
4. After the ground plane is detected, wait for the 3D model to finish downloading and after download is completed, Tap on the surface where you want to place the object.
